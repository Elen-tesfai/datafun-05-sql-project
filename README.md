# datafun-05-sql

## Overview
This project integrates Python and SQL, focusing on database interactions using SQLite. It introduces logging, a useful tool for debugging and monitoring projects, and involves creating and managing a database, building a schema, and performing various SQL operations, including queries with joins, filters, and aggregations.

## Project Description
Note: This project uses modules for practice. Jupyter will be revisited later.

Python will be used to create and manage the overall database, while SQL will interact with the relational data and tables. The DBMS is SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database widely used in browsers, mobile devices, and more. The following packages from the Python Standard Library may be used:

- `csv` - optional; `pandas` is preferred for cleaner code
- `pathlib`
- `sqlite3`
- `uuid` - optional; utility for creating unique IDs (helpful with databases)

An external dependency (e.g., `pandas`) will also be added, requiring the creation of a project-specific virtual environment using venv and pip.

- `pandas` is used to read from CSV with cleaner code
- `pyarrow` is required when using `pandas`

## Import Dependencies
```python
import pandas
import pyarrow  # required when using pandas
import numpy
import scipy
import seaborn
import matplotlib
